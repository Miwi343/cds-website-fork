                Our interview process is designed to assess a wide range of
                skills and is specific to each subteam, ensuring a tailored
                evaluation for all candidates. Typically, interviews consist of
                three distinct parts: a behavioral segment, a technical
                assessment, and a system-design/take-home challenge. The
                behavioral portion evaluates how well candidates align with the
                team&apos;s culture and values, focusing on communication skills
                and problem-solving approaches. This part of the interview also
                critically assesses cultural fit within the specific subteam to
                ensure that candidates can thrive in our collaborative
                environment. The technical segment tests specific skills
                relevant to the subteam, such as data analysis or machine
                learning topics. The system-design/take-home challenge allows
                candidates to demonstrate their ability to handle real-world
                problems and think critically about solutions.
